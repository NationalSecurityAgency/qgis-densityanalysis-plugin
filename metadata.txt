about=This plugin automates the creation of vector density heatmaps in QGIS with a heatmap explorer to examine the areas of greatest concentrations. It has two algorithms to create a gradient style and random style so that they can be used in QGIS models. Another tool allows a copied style or a .qml file to be pasted onto all selected layers. It provides an algorithm to create a raster density map of polygons and a pseudocolor processing algorithm to style the results. The plugin can be extended by installing the H3 library for very fast hexagon density maps.
