This creates a density map of overlapping polygon features by splitting the polygons along their boundaries.

WARNING: If there are dense clusters of polygons, this can create a huge set of polygon fragments which could potentially cause the algorithm to fail. In this case, run the raster versions of the "Polygon density" algorithms.

The advantage of the vector "Polygon density" algorithm is that it produces a set of vector polygons that include attributes for the number of overlaps and if selected, the source polygons that contributed to the polygon fragments.
